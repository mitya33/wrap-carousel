# Wrap Carousel

Wrap Carousel is an animated, vanilla JavaScript-powered carousel, with two notble CSS-animated effects:

- It wraps, so when one a slide is bumped off the left or right edge, it reappears at the other edge, creating an infinite cycle. This process is animated.
- The non-active slides are compressed, meaning they expand when they become active, and contract once again when they return to inactive state.

It feeds off a JSON-formatted file denoting the slides' text and images.
