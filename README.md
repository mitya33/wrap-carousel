# wrap-carousel
Wrap Carousel is an animated, vanilla JavaScript-powered carousel, with two notble CSS-animated effects: 1) It wraps, so when one a slide is bumped off the left or right edge, it reappears at the other edge; 2) Non-active slides are compressed, meaning they expand when they become active.
